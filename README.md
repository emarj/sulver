Sulver - Sudoku Solver
=============

**Disclaimer:** *This was quickly coded long time ago as part of a challenge with friends. I was quite inexperienced at the time and so the code is quite bad (expecially the backtracking part). Sooner or later I will maybe clean it up.*

Soduku solver that implements human techniques (row, column, cell unicity) and, if necessary, a naive backtracking algorithm.

Build:
```
gcc *.c -o ./bin/sulver
```

Run:
```
./bin/sulver example.sudoku
```
